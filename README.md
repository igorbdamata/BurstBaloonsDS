# BurstBaloonsDS
## About the game
The gameplay is very simple. Your objective is to get the highest score possible. To do so, you must pop as many balloons as possible before you lose all your three lives. When a balloon gets out of the screen, you lose a life.

## How to play the game
This game is developed for Nintendo DS. To play it, you have to download the ROM available here. Then you have to run it on an emulator. Theoretically, you can run it on a real Nintendo DS as well, but since the game isn't licensed, there will be no explanation about how to do this since it may be illegal.
